You are given an even integer N and an integer K.
Generate an array A of size N such that:

- 1≤ A ≤ 10^5
- The number of odd elements in the array is same as the number of even elements.
- The sum of all elements of the array is K.

If multiple such arrays exist, print any. If no such array exists, print −1 instead.


Input Format:
1. The first line consists of two space-separated integers N and K — the size of the array and the required sum.

Constraints:
- 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5, N is even
- 1 ≤ K ≤ 10^9

Output Format:
If multiple such arrays exist, print any. If no such array exists, print −1 instead.
